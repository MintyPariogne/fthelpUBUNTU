*ubuntu.txt*	personal help file for ubuntu development in vim

Write the following in the .vimrc file >
	helpt .vim/doc
which as long as this exists in that directory will make the latest changes to this file usable.

	*TODO set textwidth in Vim modeline
	*TODO set tabstop option in Vim modeline
	*TODO set filetype=help in Vim modeline
	*ERROR if Vim modeline is not in the bottom of the help file
	*ERROR if a global is set
	*ERROR I don't know any global options

The first line contains an example of a tag.
An example of a hot-link is |help.txt| that leads directly to that file.
When referring to vim option, place it between two single quotes. 'statusline'

This is a column heading ~

==============================================================================

Column heading is followed by section separator line.
I assume it was created by 78i=<Esc> which would be similar to another acceptable section with 78i-<Esc>

To quote a block of ex-commands verbatim >
	function Example_Func()
		echo "Example"
	endfuction
<

I need the list for special key name such as <PageDown> and such.
Also need list of Ctrl characters such as CTRL-X and such.
Also special are anything between braces {braces}
